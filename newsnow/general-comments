Hi

Well, i'm pretty much an academic these days.  And staying out of the
engineering path for a couple of years did score a small burden.  I had little
issue to write a good deal about the flock of sheep problem but struggled a
little more on the tree implementation.

One of the reasons i want to work in industry again is to get my coding skill
back to a level i had before meddling in the academia.  On the other hand, i
believed, when i worked in the industry, that writing well would be a good
plus.

In the end i had a good deal of time to solve the problems, therefore i played
with them.  It took me 4 hours to code the tree, and i've spent 4 hours
writing about various possibilities around the flock of sheep.  For example,
the entire section about an alternate algorithm in the flock of sheep question
is completely unnecessary but the idea just came to my mind and i've spent
another hour on that text.

I'm certain the problems can be solved faster but i had my fun in making the
solutions expressive.  I believe that the solutions are at least a little
interesting to read.

Anyhow, i hope i did not bore anyone with the long digression about the flock
of sheep.
